# Data Sources and Data Preparation
To acomplish the task we used exchange rate of USD to PLN from the archive of NBP (Narodowy Bank Polski). Firstly we have created Python script which created work-days calendar which will match days registered in NBP database. Secondly we have created python script to download specific xml files from NBP archive and extract USD to PLN exchange rate. As the next step we have prepared the gathered data to put it into csv files and upload them onto our S3 bucket.

Data containing information about BTC transactions and USD exchange rates was gathered from Amazon Public-Blockchain-Marketdata. To use the data in the correct way we had to sort and filter out the data and extract it from database. We have also prepared csv files containing two columns: date and BTC exchange rate in both currencies.
